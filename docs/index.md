# restapi Provider

Provider managing REST API queries. The only authenthication way is JWT.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "restapi" {
  uri = "https://trustbuilder.com"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `uri` (String) URI of the REST API endpoint. This serves as the base of all requests.

### Optional

- `debug` (Boolean) Enabling this will cause lots of debug information to be printed to STDOUT by the API client.
- `headers` (Map of String) A map of header names and values to set on all outbound requests. This is useful if you want to use a script via the 'external' provider or provide a pre-approved token or change Content-Type from `application/json`. If `username` and `password` are set and Authorization is one of the headers defined here, the BASIC auth credentials take precedence.
- `jwt_hashed_token` (Attributes) Configuration for JWT token generation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--jwt_hashed_token))
- `test_path` (String) If set, the provider will issue a read_method request to this path after instantiation requiring a 200 OK response before proceeding. This is useful if your API provides a no-op endpoint that can signal if this provider is configured correctly. Response data will be ignored.
- `timeout` (Number) When set, will cause requests taking longer than this time (in seconds) to be aborted.
